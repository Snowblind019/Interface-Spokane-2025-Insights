## Modern Zero Trust Definition

### What It Is

**Philosophy based on explicit trust:**
- Identify who you are
- Identify from where (phone, access point, Android device, anything)
- On-demand authentic access

**Core component:** Identity

**Holistic security everywhere:**
> "Whatever branch or vehicle you come into a SASE framework, it should be the same experience no matter what."

### What It's NOT

**Not isolated security:**
- Not just security-driven transaction
- User-driven transaction that benefits organization

**Not a one-time implementation:**
- It's a two-way street
- Continuous journey
- Balance between security and user experience

---

## The Key Principle: BALANCE

### The Danger of Imbalance

**Too much security rigidity:**
- Never evolve past 1975
- Users work around it
- Technology adoption fails

**Too much user flexibility:**
- Unmanaged risk
- Security gaps
- Compliance issues

### The Right Approach

> **Michael's Philosophy:** "If you lean too far into rigid security, you never evolve. Our tendency is to lean into what we know. Zero trust is not an isolated security-driven transaction, it's really a user-driven transaction that benefits the organization."

**The Phone System Analogy:**
- Get one chance to change
- If you don't plan well, all bad things from old system come along to new
- Same with zero trust implementation

---

## Critical Questions Every Organization Must Answer

### 1. What problems are we trying to solve?

**Common mistake:**
- Put technology or interface first
- Don't align with actual business needs

**Better approach:**
- Start with the problem
- Understand the use case
- Then find the solution

**Michael's Teaching Background:**
> "When you teach school, you know your customers (students). Technology is great, but if that technology doesn't move that student forward in their learning, it's too hard to use, you're not going to get adoption."

### 2. How do we do it maintaining balance?

**Considerations:**
- Some use cases allow flexibility
- Others require more control
- Hybrid SASE framework
- Use resources more efficiently

### 3. How can we use resources more efficiently?

**Goal:**
- Right level of security for right use case
- Not over-engineering
- Not under-protecting

### 4. How do we manage user experience without increasing risk?

> **Core tenet:** "You can manage the user experience without increasing risk."

This was part of original SASE definition in 2019.

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Whole Foods Palm Payment

**The Use Case:**
- Pay for groceries with palm print
- Linked to Amazon Prime/credit card
- No wallet needed
- No phone needed

**Michael's Story:**
- Bikes 60 miles
- Doesn't like things in pockets
- Stops for food and beverage
- Places hand on scanner
- Done in 30 seconds

**The Balance Question:**
- Who's okay with paying with hand? *(raises hand)*
- What's the risk in buying food this way?
- Low risk transaction = appropriate security level

**Alternative (traditional way):**
- Need wallet
- Find credit card
- Maybe Samsung/Apple/Google Pay etc
- Maybe phone locked
- Maybe forgot password
- All for buying food

**Lesson:** Match security to risk level

### Example 2: Delta Chat AI

**The Problem:**
- Couldn't check in for flight
- Needed to resolve quickly

**The Solution:**
- AI asks simple yes/no questions
- "You can't check-in. Yes or no?"
- "Do you need to speak with representative? Yes or no?"

**Why It Works:**
- Doesn't expect user to know what to say
- Guides the process
- Simple, effective

**Contrast:**
- Bad AI = messy, confusing
- Good AI = intelligent simplicity

**Application to Zero Trust:**
- Make it simple
- Guide users
- Don't expect them to be experts

## Panel Insights: Core Concepts

### SASE Without Zero Trust is Scary

**Steve's Key Quote:**
> "SASE without zero trust is scary. Moving the edge out, which is what every vendor is talking about, if you don't have the zero trust piece, if you're not confirming the identity and scoping access based on that, then moving that edge out does nothing for you rather than creating a bigger attack surface."

**What This Means:**
- SASE moves security to the edge
- Without zero trust, you've just expanded vulnerability
- Identity confirmation is critical
- Scope access appropriately

### Same Security Posture Everywhere

**Eric's Addition:**
> "Zero trust and SASE go hand in hand in every way. The main piece is we're not trusting anything anywhere. The same security posture needs to exist regardless of where users are - laptop, branch, remote, cloud. We need to find a way to provide that authentication and understand who's connecting, where, how, why, what."

**Five W's of Zero Trust:**
- **Who** is connecting?
- **Where** are they connecting from?
- **How** are they connecting?
- **Why** are they connecting?
- **What** are they accessing?

## The Pace Question: How Fast Should You Move?

### The Question

**Is it more important to do things fast/faster now than 10 years ago?**

10 years ago: Could spend a year building the ivory tower

Now: ?

### Panel Responses

**Joel:**
> "You have to be thoughtful. It depends on your organization, your users. You gotta understand your frameworks, talk to your people. A lot depends on communication internally. I can't give an answer on how fast you should or shouldn't do it, but I think you have to be very thoughtful."

**Eric:**
> "Zero trust is a process. It's not going from 1 to 100 in 20 [minutes]. Finding a way - a balance - of working towards it, just being a little better every day and getting to that end solution is the right pace."

**Being Pragmatic:**
- Not rushing
- Not stalling
- Steady progress
- Measurable improvements

**But Also...**

**Michael's Reality Check:**
> "You have to move fast. If you take 5 years to build the ivory tower in today's world, I've coded an entire app in a week from my phone using Replit platform. 158 iterations. Would have cost $100K+ 10 years ago."

**The Balance:**
- Move with speed
- But with guardrails
- Not reckless
- Not paralyzed

## How to Ensure User Experience Isn't Sacrificed

### 1. Monitor Users (Visibility)

**Eric's Point:**
> "Bringing in monitoring of those users to a SASE platform is huge. With visibility, we have Digital Experience Monitoring as piece of the SASE platform. We know where users are seeing problems - is it endpoint? ISP? Somewhere along the path?"

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't fix what you can't see
- Need data to make informed decisions
- Visibility drives improvement

### 2. Craft Simple Use Cases

**Michael's Philosophy:**
> "We should craft use cases that are simple. We actually want to have use cases that people want to use the process. Imagine that. You want the ability for someone to go home at 2 o'clock in the afternoon because everything's running so great."

**Goal:**
- Make it easier, not harder
- People WANT to use it
- Reduces resistance

### 3. Get Stakeholder Buy-In

**Steve's Critical Point:**
> "Bringing in your stakeholders across the organization to get buy-in. If HR turns around and says 'you deploy this and none of our users can deploy an agent on their phone because we're not paying for their phone,' there goes your entire planning process out the window."

**Who Needs to Buy In:**
- Executives (dollar chain)
- Enforcement team (IT security)
- Individual business units
- HR (policies)
- Finance (expenses)
- Users themselves (especially important ones)

**Example:**
- Healthcare: Get buy-in from nurses, doctors, the actual users
- If you make it too complex, users will revolt
- They'll use "sneakernet" - literally walk around your controls

### 4. Pick Small Wins First

**Joel's Advice:**
> "Focus on where you can have success. Pick something where you can get a win. Then you can have success and move on to the next thing. Don't try to solve everything all at once. Get those little wins as you progress."

**Also:**
> "User experience - I don't want to have to log in to MFA 364 times during the day. You gotta think about that."

### 5. Communication is Critical

**Joel again:**
> "A lot of this is dependent upon communication internally in your organization."

**What to communicate:**
- What you're doing
- Why you're doing it
- How it affects them
- What's in it for them

## What Metrics or Signals Indicate Zero Trust Maturity?

### The Concept of Inertia/Technical Debt

**Michael's Definition:**
> "What are those things that you did that you knew you didn't love, but have been with you for the last 10 years, and you don't see a path to get out of it?"

**Examples:**
- Applications running off AS/400
- Connected to single Cisco router
- If something happens to that connection, big trouble
- "How can I improve this without breaking it?"

**Modern Footprint:**
> "How can I do it slowly and not take forever? That to me is a modern footprint."

### Metric 1: User Adoption

**Steve:**
> "Obviously user adoption. If you're looking at logs and for a couple weeks you're not going 'what the hell is this?' then you're probably doing okay. If every day when you're looking at logs you're saying 'oh crap, what about that?' then that wasn't part of the zero trust plan."

### Metric 2: Users Don't Notice

**Eric:**
> "If users don't notice there's a change, that signals maturity. We modernized the environment without the user noticing or seeing a difference. That's really the goal."

### Metric 3: Microsoft Security Score

**Joel:**
> "Microsoft Security Score is great. Just kind of get a baseline on where you're at. Try to leverage whatever you have in place to understand."

### Metric 4: Quantitative Risk Decrease

**Steve:**
> "See your residual risk - a quantitative residual risk number in your risk register - decreasing. When you're getting that residual risk number closer to zero in your system, if your efforts aren't having an impact on your risk register, then you're probably not seeing progress."

### Metric 5: Partner/Peer Engagement

**Joel:**
> "Engage partners. Don't do it alone. Have peers, partners help you understand and work through that."

### The Critical Balance

**Michael's Reminder:**
> "If you have a really good score but your users hate using the systems, that's not success."

**Both required:**
- Security metrics improving
- User satisfaction maintained

## The Phone Cutover Story: A Maturity Example

**Michael's Experience:**

**Why he always did cutovers Thursday 1 AM:**
- By Friday, whole week has passed
- Most people don't make major changes Friday
- Always something goes wrong
- But if environment mature, technical debt resolved, no inertia:
  - Cutover is not-event
  - Friday: people pick up phone, it works
  - Get voicemail, everything works
  - Some numbers don't dial, some special things broken
  - But conducting business

**Application to Zero Trust:**
> "When you're doing zero trust correctly in my opinion, and when you're maintaining that balance, and it's not ubiquitous (everyone has different architecture), but it's all based on core principles of zero trust. It goes back to being pragmatic."

**The Warning:**
- Can follow all the rules
- Can build against NIST framework
- But if it takes 5 years: missed the boat
- Upset user community
- Won't get adoption

## Modern Use Case: Mobile Workspace

### The Demonstration

**What Michael showed:**
- Samsung phone with DeX
- AR glasses (Viture brand) connected to Samsung phone
- Keyboard and mouse connected via bluetooth to phone
- Complete mobile workstation
- Fits in small bag

**Why It's Relevant:**

**Question to audience:**
"How many have thought about or know anybody using this?"
- Very few hands went up
- Shows gap in thinking about future use cases

### The Zero Trust Challenge

**How do you protect this?**

**Not about:**
- Enterprise wireless
- Complex systems

**It IS about:**
> "Literally a guy with a phone, a keyboard and a mouse that just wants to do something."

**This is the future.**

### The Solution

**Eric:**
> "Flexibility goes a long way. You need to plan for today, for tomorrow. Understand where your users are coming from, where they will be coming from down the road. Really make sure that the security posture, regardless of where they're from, is the same."

**Steve:**
> "The flexibility piece is huge. You can't have reduction in your trusted zone just by virtue of where the user has to work. COVID taught us a lot. We have to be able to meet the user where they're at without reducing security level or increasing risk."

### Why This Matters

**Workplace evolution:**
- Remote work normalized
- Mobile devices more powerful
- Users expect flexibility

**DR consideration:**
- COVID example: uncertainty about quarantine
- "We might have to spend the night here"
- If workforce tooled with this: much more flexible
- Can quickly pivot when things stop

**The Efficiency:**
- Can't carry PC around
- Even laptop has power issues
- This is more mobile, more flexible

---

## Simple Maturity Example: Firewall Schedules

**Michael's Insight:**
> "One of the things I love that shows maturity when I'm out consulting is something as simple as built into our products from the very beginning: schedules on firewall policies."

**What it is:**
- Schedule when policy is active
- Form of zero trust

**Example:**
- Don't want people accessing application midnight-6 AM
- Put schedule on policy
- It's closed during those hours
- You don't get in

**Why it matters:**
- Simple
- Effective
- Often overlooked
- Form of least privilege

## Advice for CISOs Starting Zero Trust Journey

### Michael: Be Intentional

> "Be intentional with what you're doing. What problem are you trying to solve? Not is this really cool technology. What problem are you trying to solve?"

### Steve: Pick a Framework and Follow It

> "Start the journey. Everybody wants to get there, but you have no idea where to start? Go look at what frameworks are out there and follow it. It will give you step-by-step goals to reach."

**Frameworks mentioned:**
- CISA
- CIS
- NIST

> "They're going to tell you how to go from nothing to [zero trust]. So start the journey, that's most important."

### Eric: Start Today

> "Start today. If you can't start yesterday, today's the next best day to do it."

### Joel: Communicate with Stakeholders

> "Everyone from knowledge workers to decision makers to budget approvers needs to be in the room."

### Michael: "I Wanna Go Fast" (with Guardrails)

**The Talladega Nights Reference:**
> "I wanna go fast, but I want to go fast with guardrails. Go as fast as you can without breaking your car or hurting others."

**What this means for zero trust:**
- Fast implementation
- But stable
- Efficient
- Not bogged down in details
- Just works
- Flexible enough for new use cases

---

## Key Philosophy: Zero Trust is a Journey

### What Zero Trust Is NOT

**Cannot:**
- Just purchase technology
- Say "we have zero trust now"
- Be done in one project

**Steve's Key Point:**
> "The flexibility piece is huge. You have to do it without reducing your security level. The planning that goes into it, the effort, the fact that you can't just buy a piece of technology and say 'zero trust' is huge."

### What Zero Trust IS

**It's a:**
- Journey
- Concept
- Architecture
- Methodology
- Process you work towards

**Requires:**
- Planning
- Effort
- Continuous improvement
- Cultural change
- Organizational buy-in

### The Predictability Benefit

**Steve:**
> "If nothing else, you're getting predictability where everything else in the world is unpredictable. If you can control your environment..."

**This is valuable.**

---

## Implementation Wisdom

### From Planning to Execution

**The Mistake:**
Building in isolation, then deploying

**The Better Way:**
- Include users from start
- Test incrementally
- Gather feedback
- Adjust based on reality
- Communicate throughout

### The Sneakernet Problem

**Steve's Warning:**
> "If your users are using sneakernet - meaning they're literally walking around the fences that you built, delivering things outside of the programs and policies you've built - then it's worthless. You're not reducing risk, you're not controlling the user experience first off."

**What causes sneakernet:**
- Too complex
- Too rigid
- Not aligned with actual work
- No user input during design

**Solution:**
- Get buy-in from business units
- Include actual users
- Make it work for them
- Balance security with usability

---

## DR and Zero Trust

### The COVID Lesson

**Scenario Michael described:**
- At customer site in trailer
- March 15th (early COVID)
- "We weren't sure if we were going to get quarantined"
- Called wife: "Customer says we can't leave, might spend the night"

**If everyone had mobile workspace:**
- Non-issue
- Work from anywhere
- Business continuity maintained

### Broader DR Implications

**Traditional approach:**
- Fixed locations
- Specific hardware
- Rigid infrastructure

**Modern approach:**
- Work from anywhere
- Any device
- Same security
- Same access

**This requires:**
- Zero trust architecture
- SASE framework
- User-centric design

---

## The Technical Foundation

### Simple Architecture Principles

**From Michael's diagram:**

**Coming from:**
- Agent-based device (laptop with Fortinet client)
- Mobile device (agentless or with agent)
- Thin branch/access point (agentless)

**Providing access to:**
- Internet (commodity)
- Zero trust access (granular, direct, on-demand)

**Key point:**
> "No matter where you come from - agent or agentless - you can still have that on-demand granular direct zero trust access."

**That's simplicity.**

### DR Use Case Examples

**Retailers (Nordstrom):**
- People don't want to wait at register
- Transaction blocks sale
- Need 5-15 second recovery

**Why this matters:**
- User experience = revenue
- Downtime = lost sales
- Zero trust enables fast recovery

---

## Final Takeaways

### 1. Zero Trust is User-Driven

Not just about security. About enabling business while managing risk.

### 2. Balance is Everything

Too much security = no adoption
Too much flexibility = too much risk
Find the middle ground for YOUR use cases

### 3. Start the Journey Today

Don't wait for perfect
Start with framework
Make incremental progress

### 4. Get Everyone in the Room

Knowledge workers to executives
Budget holders to end users
Can't do it in isolation

### 5. Move Fast with Guardrails

Speed matters in modern world
But not reckless
Thoughtful and rapid

### 6. Meet Users Where They Are

Pandemic proved flexibility essential
Modern work requires modern approach
Don't reduce security, increase adaptability

### 7. Pick Small Wins

Don't boil the ocean
Get victories
Build momentum

### 8. Measure What Matters

User adoption
Risk reduction
Both required for success

### 9. It's a Process, Not a Product

Can't buy zero trust
It's a journey
Continuous improvement

### 10. Communication is Critical

Internal stakeholders
External partners
Ongoing dialogue
