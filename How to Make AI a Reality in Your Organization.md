# How to Make AI a Reality in Your Organization

**Presented by:** Marni Carmichael, VP of Marketing at ImageSource

---

This session felt more like a sales pitch for ImageSource more than anything but helpful insights can be gathered nonetheless.

## The Current AI Project Landscape: The Hard Truth

### The Statistics (From Gartner Survey of 400+ Top Organizations)

| Metric | Reality |
|--------|---------|
| **Average POC (Proof of Concept) Timeline** | 8 months |
| **Budget Growth** | $1M → $2-10M (just for POC) |
| **Enterprise Rollout Rate** | Only 10% |

**Translation:** Think about what you could have done with $2-10M in a REAL rollout versus just proving a concept.

### Where We Are: The Trough of Disillusionment

> **Gartner's Term:** "Trough of Disillusionment"

**What This Means:**
- We got really educated on AI
- We embraced the hype
- Now we're falling into reality
- "How does this work? How does it operate within our security requirements? Our objectives?"

### The Personal Productivity Trap

**What's Working:**
- Copilot for individuals
- ChatGPT for research
- AI taking less time
- Better emails
- Personal assistance

**What's NOT Working:**
- Translating to business value
- Going back to your organization and saying "everybody's writing better emails, taking 10% less time"
- Management thinking: "Does that mean staff reduction? More workload? How are we getting better?"

**The Core Problem:**
> **Personal productivity ≠ operational efficiency**

This is what we've been learning. This is what ImageSource helps organizations overcome.

## Why AI Projects Fail: Four Critical Gaps

### 1. Not Aligned to Real Business Objectives

**Wrong Approach:**
- "Let's see what AI will do to improve our process"
- No specific measurements
- No success criteria

**Right Approach:**
- Reduce abandonment rates by 15%
- Process transactions 10% faster
- Detect fraud automatically
- Reduce complaint handling time
- Those are REAL objectives

**Example - Alaska SNAP Benefits:**
- **Problem:** Taking over 40 minutes to complete application
- **Risk:** Losing federal funding
- **Solution:** Reduced to 7 minutes
- **Result:** Critical funding for families preserved

### 2. Aging Line-of-Business Systems

**The Problem:**
- Many organizations support 5, 10, 20+ line-of-business systems
- These systems are aging
- Lost expertise and support
- Lost ability/confidence to connect to other systems
- Creates silos

**Why This Matters:**
- Can't automate additional processes
- Cost of rip-and-replace is VERY high
- Need tools to connect existing systems

**ImageSource's Approach:**
- Identify gaps
- Figure out ways to connect systems (APIs, AI, RPA, screen scraping)
- Work with what you have
- Break down silos

### 3. Communication & Collaboration Breakdowns

**The Pattern:**
- Teams assemble: knowledge workers, administrators, department managers
- Vote: "We're getting this project going!"
- Executive sponsorship immediately disappears
- Leaders move on to next problem

**When You Escalate:**
- "We need help resolving this"
- "We need decision-making"
- Response: "This next thing is my priority, can't go backwards"

**The Reality:**
- Priorities shift
- AI projects get complex quickly
- Leaders move on before seeing results

**ImageSource Solution:**
- Methodologies to keep team connected
- Work through projects systematically
- Maintain engagement across all levels

### 4. Shifting Priorities

**Challenges:**
- New legislation
- New compliance requirements (especially financial services)
- Timeframes get tighter
- Leaders start moving on before project shows results

**Result:** Projects abandoned mid-flight

## ImageSource's 6-Step Methodology

### Step 1: AI Education Workshops (1+ Days)

- Learning event
- Educational event
- Go over terms and how things work
- Help teams brainstorm use cases
- Start prioritizing

**Immediate Value:**
- Map AI initiatives to REAL business value
- What are your most manual processes?
- Where do you have most attrition/turnover?
- Where are budgets tightening on hiring?
- Strategic opportunities to improve customer/citizen experience

**Focus Areas:**
- Reduce abandonment rates
- Improve transaction times
- Remove barriers to service delivery
- Financial services: How to be more competitive? Faster loans? Better fraud detection?

**Examples Covered:**
- List of AI trends
- How they're used
- How ImageSource envisions them being used
- Making content "AI ready"

**Resources:**
- Available at ImageSource.com
- Webinar library with 4-5 months of content
- List constantly growing

### Step 2: Build AI Fluency Across Departments

**The Goal:**
- Everyone speaks same terms
- Everyone knows what they mean
- Everyone understands potential outcomes

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:**
> Include leadership in discussions. Final budget decider needs to be in the room. Agency leader, director, or deputy director MUST be present.

**Why This Matters:**
- Build consensus
- Build excitement
- Get out of the "trough of disillusionment"
- Understand "how can we really use these tools to become more efficient?"

**Outcome:**
- Unified understanding
- Executive buy-in from start
- Shared vision

### Step 3: AI Exploration & Use Case Prioritization

**Key Questions:**
- What's critical?
- What's core?
- What's customer/citizen-facing?
- What's improving knowledge worker efficiency?
- What regulations are you at risk for?
- What regulations will tighten in next 18 months?

**The Process Mapping Exercise:**

**Why ALL Levels Must Participate:**

Ask department leader: "How does this process work?"
- Response: "Oh, I have it memorized: 1, 2, 3"

Ask knowledge worker: "How does this process work?"
- Response: "Well, then I gotta email this person, get this document, wait for approval..."

**The Gap:**
- Leaders have perception
- Workers have reality
- You need BOTH views

**Critical Questions:**
- Is this one process or multiple?
- What are we really solving?
- What can move affordably into POC?

### Step 4: Data Preparation & POC Testing

**Making Data "AI Ready":**
- ImageSource specialty: content repositories
- Historical transaction information
- Historical customer information
- Can help build repository or layer on existing one

**Deployment Options:**
- On-premise
- In your cloud (government cloud)
- In your cloud in YOUR Azure/AWS
- **Not** shared with OpenAI or other vendors
- **Not** phoning home

**Testing Phase:**
- Test with knowledge workers
- Will they adopt it?
- Do they understand what's happening?
- Does it make their job better?

**ROI Calculation:**
- Based on initial goals you set
- Measurable outcomes

**Assessment Criteria:**
- Does it meet success criteria?
- Risk and compliance acceptable?
- Stakeholder feedback and adoption positive?
- Can you maintain it yourself?
- Do you have right partnerships?

**Decision Point:**
> **GO or NO-GO on rolling out**

### Step 5: Deploy & Train

**ImageSource Experience:**
- 30+ years doing digital transformation projects
- Smaller organization - don't deliver box and say "good luck"
- Stay close until project succeeds
- Structured methodology

**Training Components:**

#### User Training
- How it works
- **How to detect bias**
- **How to detect hallucinations**
- Not depending on solution that isn't giving valuable results

#### Expectation Management
- **Critical:** Cost of change is high
- Expectations must be realistic and monitored

**The OCR → ML Transition:**

Marni states her background is in turning paper into data (OCR). Challenging to change thinking:
- What does OCR do?
- What does AI/ML visual transformation do?
- Big gap in understanding

**The Comparison Trap:**
- Don't just compare accuracy rates
- Don't just compare metrics to old OCR engine
- **This is doing something new and different**
- Must raise expectations of output

**Model Training:**
- Experience in prompt writing
- Model testing and building
- Don't share models across customers
- Don't share data
- But can guide you through process

**Dataset Requirements:**
- Most complex unstructured processes: ~40 samples needed
- More structured data: as few as 10 samples
- "We're taken off and really flying"

### Step 6: Celebrate & Socialize Success

**Old School Approach:**
- Want to have a person
- Want project completion celebration
- Help you socialize results

**Why This Matters:**
- Continue buy-in for next department
- Continue buy-in for next project
- Build confidence in change
- Motivate through inevitable resistance cycles

**Support for Recognition:**
- Help organizations nominate for awards
- NASCIO (National Association of State CIOs)
- Other industry organizations
- Plan this from project start

**Content = Business Process:**
- Always represents business process
- Always represents customer interaction

**Onboarding Methods:**
- Scanning (original method)
- API connections to line-of-business systems
- EDI transaction data
- Email attachment (right-click, send to workflow)
- "You name it, we onboard content"

### Modular Suite Architecture

**How It Works:**
- Modular platform
- Get what you need
- Turn on additional modules as needs evolve

**AI Engine:**
- Drops into any module
- Called "AI MC"
- Flexible integration

**Presentation Layer:**
- Makes citizen service delivery easier
- Puts layer on top of line-of-business systems
- Citizens/customers interact directly
- Start transactions
- Start communications
- Portal, mobile, whatever you need

### Licensing Model

**ImageSource Approach:**
- Concurrent users (not volume-based like competitors)
- Flexible assignment

**Volume Considerations:**
- Affects infrastructure needs
- How many servers?
- How much infrastructure?

**Licensing Process:**
- "You have 50 users"
- Ask questions: "Are all 50 hitting system at same time?"
- "What's workload?"
- Flexible with license assignment

**Completely Web-Based:**
- No keys or client installations
- Occasional audit: "Volume tripled, let's talk about licensing"
- No hard cutoffs (learned from Kofax experience - "key at back would turn off at 50,001")

### AI Deployment Options

**Customer Question:** "I don't want cloud, I want local AI"

**ImageSource Response:**
